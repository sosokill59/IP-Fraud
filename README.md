# IP-Fraud

Check the reputation of an IP with ipqualityscore.com's API.

You have to create account on www.ipqualityscore.com/create-account, and then get your API key.

This script will generate 2 files: 1 JSON file wich contains the informations about the IP and 1 HTML file to display this informations in a table.

I added a JS functionality in order to automatically refresh the HTML table presenting the data.
